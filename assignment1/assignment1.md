# Assignment 1 - Stock Market

## Q1: Explain how both REST and GraphQL could be used to handle the data requests and updates required by the system.

### Rest Implementation

#### Important Definition

**Stocks** : Ticker symbol, company name, current price... (stock representation at current time of request)

**Quotes** : Timestamp, price, Volume... (Historical representation of the stock base on a period of time)

#### Basic Endpoint Structure and Request

This is a basic structure used to simulate data communication for our stock market app. This does not include all possible endpoints, but only includes the basic structure to relay how such communication would be done in this scenario.

##### **/stocks: Base endpoint**

- **GET /stocks :** Retrieves a list of all available stocks. Response can be made in a JSON array of stock object.

##### **/stocks/{ticker}: Operations specific to a stock using their ticker identifier**

- **GET /stocks/{ticker}:** Retrives detailed information about a specific stock ticker.
- **POST /stocks/{ticker} (users would typically not use this, but platform that that manages stock market data will):** Create a new stock.
- **PUT /stocks/{ticker} (users would typically not use this, but platform that that manages stock market data will):** used to update data of a stock
- **DELETE /stocks/{ticker} (users would typically not use this, but platform that that manages stock market data will):** delete a stock.

##### **/quotes/{ticker}: View historical quotes for a particular ticker**

- **GET /quotes/{ticker}:** Retrieves historical data about a specific ticker. This request can be a large request as it is requesting data over a time period.

### GraphQL Implementation

GraphQL, as we learned in class, uses a single point to handle any requests. Here are examples using the our notes code snippets and GraphQL [documentation](https://graphql.org/learn/) as examples.

#### Retrieving/[Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) any stocks

```
query{
    stocks(limit:10){
        ticker
        companyName
        currentPrice
    }
}
```

#### Retrieving/[Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) specific stocks

```
query{
    stocks(ticker: "AAPL"){ // Apple ticker symbole
        ticker
        companyName
        currentPrice
        dailyHigh
        dailyLow
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Retrieving/[Query](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/) stock quote

```
query{
    quote(ticker: "AAPL", period: " daily, hourly, 15min, 5min"){ // Apple ticker symbole
        ticker
        price
        volume
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Creating/[Mutating](https://graphql.org/learn/mutations/) stock

```
mutation{
    createStock(ticker: "AAPL",companyName:"Apple", currentPrice: "199.99$" ){ // Apple ticker symbole
        ticker
        companyName
        currentPrice
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Updating/[Mutating](https://graphql.org/learn/mutations/) stock

```
mutation{
    updateStock(ticker: "AAPL",companyName:"Apple Inc."){ // Apple ticker symbole
        ticker
        companyName
        ...
    }
}
```

#### Deleting/[Mutating](https://graphql.org/learn/mutations/) stock

```
mutation{
    deleteStock(ticker: "AAPL",companyName:"Apple", currentPrice: "199.99$" ){ // Apple ticker symbole
        ticker
        companyName
        currentPrice
        ...
    }
}
```

### REST VS GraphQL

#### Pros of REST

- Simple and straightforward to setup. For simple systeme rest is best.
- REST is well-established and used widely.

#### Cons of REST

- Over/under-Fetching
- Real-time communication mechanism limitation

#### Pros of GraphQL

- Avoides over/under-Fetching, gets you what you need at the request stage
- Can use subscription for real-time (uses Websockets)

#### Cons of GraphQL

- Real-time communication mechanism limitation
- Difficult to implement

We would argue that GraphQL would be the slightly superior system as it prevents data from being over or underfetched by the user. However, both lack mechanisms to communicate in real-time or are not easy to implement.

## Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication

### How would WebSockets work

WebSockets establishes a persistent bi-directional communication channel between the client and the server. This is fundamentally different from a REST and a GraphQL system. Hereâ€™s how this would be implemented in our scenario:

#### Connection (Handshake)

The client starts the connection to the server with an HTTP request/handshake. From that handshake, the client demands a communication upgrade, which proceeds the WebSocket connection over a TCP connection.

#### Bi-directional data communication

For example, when the Stock Platform gets updated data about a stock that the user is monitoring, that update is immediately pushed to the user in the form of a live graph or current live pricing. The great thing is that the client does not need to make a new request to the server because the connection was never closed, which eliminates the need to constantly refresh the client.

### WebSockets vs REST & GraphQL

#### Request VS Push

Both REST and GraphQL both fundementaly rely on requests to work which in the scenario is their Downfall: Request relies on the client to constantly be requesting data to work, which can be slow and taxing. WebSockets lets the server push data whenever the data is ready to be pushed. This is a fundamental difference between the two.

#### Connection Persistence

REST and GraphQL both use short-lived HTTP connections, meaning once the data request has Once completed, the connection is done. WebSockets, on the other hand, uses a persistent connection, meaning the connection will be open as long as the client and the server are active.

#### Efficency

Both REST and GraphQL will waste bandwidth and sEver resources in a real-time update usage because the client is constantly requesting more updates when the data has yet to have changed. WebSockets will, because of their persistent connection, update the user on its own without the need for a new request. This will dramatically reduce latency and improve user experience.

## Section 3: Technology Recommendation and Justification

Recommend which technology (or combination of technologies) you would choose for your system: REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, or a hybrid approach.

Justify your recommendation based on your analysis in Sections 1 and 2.

- Consider factors such as data complexity, real-time requirements, scalability, and ease of use for developers.
- Explain why this combination is best suited for your use case in terms of performance, scalability, and real-time capabilities.
